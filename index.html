<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real<br>
    I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long<br>
    (Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)<br>
    I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real<br>
    I wanna find something I've wanted all along<br>
    Somewhere I belong<br><br></p>

<p>And I've got nothing to say<br>
    I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face<br>
    (I was confused)<br>
    Looking everywhere only to find<br>
    That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind<br><br></p>

<p>What do I have but negativity<br>
    'Cause I can't justify the way, everyone is looking at me<br>
    (Nothing to lose)<br>
    Nothing to gain, hollow and alone<br>
    And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own<br><br></p>

<p>I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real<br>
    I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long<br>
    (Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)<br>
    I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real<br>
    I wanna find something I've wanted all along<br>
    Somewhere I belong<br><br></p>

<p>I will never know myself until I do this on my own<br>
    And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed<br>
    I will never be anything 'til I break away from me<br>
    I will break away, I'll find myself today<br><br></p>

<p>I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real<br>
    I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long<br>
    (Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)<br>
    I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real<br>
    I wanna find something I've wanted all along<br><br></p>

<p>I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real<br>
    I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long<br>
    (Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)<br>
    I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real<br><br></p>

<p>I wanna find something I've wanted all along<br>
    Somewhere I belong<br>
    (I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm)<br>
    Somewhere I belong<br>
    (I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm)<br>
    Somewhere I belong<br>
    Somewhere I belong<br><br></p>
